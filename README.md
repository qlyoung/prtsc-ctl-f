prtsc-ctl-f
===========

*Search all visible text on your screen*

This is a simple python script that glues together a random screenshot
function I found on StackOverflow with the Tesseract OCR library to
give you an amazingly powerful and innovative tool that takes a screenshot,
runs it through Tesseract, and dumps any recognized text to stdout.

Dependencies
------------
    # sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
