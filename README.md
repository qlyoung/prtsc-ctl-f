prtsc-ctl-f
===========

*Search all visible text on your screen*

This is a simple python script that glues together a random screenshot function I found on StackOverflow with the only
available OCR library for python to give you an amazingly powerful and innovative thing that takes a screenshot and
does OCR on it and sees if the word u r looking 4 is in the screenshot

Dependencies
------------
+tesseract-ocr ($ apt-get install tesseract-ocr)

kthx
